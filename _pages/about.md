I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [MIT's Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Retsef Levi. I design data-driven tools and use rigorous modeling techniques to enable better decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on high-impact problems arising in industry. In this vein, my research leverages optimization and machine learning to tackle critical logistical and operational challenges.

Currently, in collaboration with [Healthcare Systems Engineering (HSE) at Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/research/healthcare-systems-engineering), I am developing a machine learning-based approach to support real-time capacity management decisions and improve resource allocation.

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Rice University, with a double major in Operations Research and Mathematical Economics.
