Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at [MIT's Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Retsef Levi. My research spans mathematical optimization and machine learning, focused on solving critical operational challenges in industry settings. I develop data-driven tools and use rigorous modeling techniques for decision-making under uncertainty.

Currently, in collaboration with the Healthcare Systems Engineering team at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/patient-care/services-and-specialties/locations/massachusetts-general-hospital), I am designing a machine learning and generative AI-enabled framework to assist in real-time capacity management decisions and improve resource allocation. This work is supported by the MGH-MIT Doctoral Fellowship.

Before MIT, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Rice University, with a double major in Operations Research (School of Engineering) and Mathematical Economics (School of Social Sciences).
