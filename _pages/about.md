Hello! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [MIT's Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Retsef Levi. My research spans mathematical optimization and machine learning, with an emphasis on addressing critical operational challenges in industry settings. I develop data-driven tools and use rigorous modeling techniques to enable better decision-making under uncertainty.

Currently, in collaboration with [Healthcare Systems Engineering (HSE) at Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/research), I am designing a genAI-enabled machine learning framework to support real-time capacity management decisions and improve resource allocation.

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Rice University, with a double major in Operations Research (School of Engineering) and Mathematical Economics (School of Social Sciences).
